Object Detection with CNNs, ViT, and YOLO

# Project Description: Object Detection Algorithm Comparison on Pascal VOC 2007
## Overview

This project aims to implement and compare the performance of several object detection algorithms, specifically Faster R-CNN with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), using the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. The goal is to evaluate these models based on their accuracy, efficiency, and speed in detecting objects across various categories in the dataset.

## Dataset: Pascal VOC 2007

Source: The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) 2007 dataset.

Content: The dataset contains images across 20 categories with annotations, including object labels and bounding boxes.

Task: Object detection, requiring the model to predict both the classes and the locations of objects in images.

# Data Processing

## Preprocessing:
Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 800x800 pixels) for model input.

Normalize pixel values to a range suitable for neural network inputs.

Convert annotations to a format compatible with the models, including class labels and bounding box coordinates.

Augmentation (Optional):
Apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling to increase the diversity of training data and improve model robustness.

Data Loader Setup:
Implement data loaders with efficient batching, shuffling, and parallel processing to streamline training and evaluation.

# Algorithms

## Faster R-CNN with ViT Backbone:
Utilize a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) as the feature extraction backbone in place of the conventional CNN architecture.
Integrate this backbone with the Faster R-CNN framework, modifying the region proposal network (RPN) and detection heads to work with ViT features.
YOLO (specific version, e.g., YOLOv5):
Configure the chosen YOLO model for the Pascal VOC dataset, adjusting input dimensions and output classes.
Optimize the model settings for a balance between detection accuracy and inference speed.
Training

## Environment: Python with PyTorch, Google Colab, leveraging CUDA for GPU acceleration.

Loss Functions: Utilize appropriate loss functions for object detection, combining classification and bounding box regression losses.

Optimization: Apply optimizers like SGD or Adam, with learning rate schedules and regularization techniques to improve training outcomes.

# Evaluation and Comparison

## Metrics:
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1 score.
Measure inference speed and computational efficiency to compare model practicality in real-world applications.
## Analysis:
Conduct a thorough analysis of the models' performance across different object categories and under varying conditions (e.g., object sizes, occlusion).
Compare the models qualitatively by visualizing detection results, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

## Reporting and Documentation

Results: Compile detailed results, including quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, in a structured report or presentation.
